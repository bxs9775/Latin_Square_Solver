# Latin Square Solver
[Link to live version](https://bxs9775.github.io/Latin_Square_Solver/)

This program provides a simple program to help solve Latin Square puzzles. Latin Square Puzzles are puzzles where you have to fill a grid with letters (or other values), so there is one and exacly one of each symbol in each row and column. My solver allows for there to be multiple empty squares in a row or column, which violates the standard rules of the puzzle.

INSTRUCTIONS:
* Use the size and range dropdown to set the initial parameters of the puzzle. (Note: changing the size clears the puzzle)
* Click on a cell on the grid to selected. Click outside the grid to deselect.
* Use the keyboard to change the value of the selected cell.
* Press Solve to run the solving code.
* If one one solution is found, it is displayed on the grid. If multiple solutions are found they are outputed to the console. For multiple or nosolutions the original grid is not changed.
* Press Clear to remove all values from the grid.
* Press Reset to clear the result message and reenable editing mode.
